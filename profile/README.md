# Ultrasonics Group - GitHub repository
The Ultrasonics Group at UCL conducts cutting-edge research in biomedical and therapeutic ultrasound, collaborating extensively with academic groups, clinicians, and industry partners.

Our work spans both experimental and computational studies. This GitHub site hosts various tools we've developed for computational modelling, designing experiments, and data postprocessing.

## Highlight: OptimUS - Fast 3D Full-Wave Solver
In collaboration with mathematicians at UCL, Cambridge University, and Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile, we developed OptimUS: a fast 3D full-wave solver using the Boundary Element Method (BEM). BEM efficiently solves Helmholtz transmission problems by reformulating volumetric partial differential equations into surface potential representations at material interfaces. Developed in Python with a user-friendly Jupyter Notebook interface, OptimUS computes acoustic waves in piecewise homogeneous media (in frequency domain) with minimal numerical pollution and dispersion. It offers significant runtime reductions compared to traditional volumetric solvers.
